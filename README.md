# Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Nishant

## Explorer | Freelancer | Udemy Instructor

After seven years immersed in the world of New Age technology, my favorite thing is undoubtedly my keyboard. In this journey, I've honed my coding skills, treating my code as a skill and my keyboard as a weapon in the battlefield of technology.

From childhood dreams of being a hacker to mastering Python, JavaScript, C, and C++, my passion for learning everything about computers has become my driving force. I firmly believe that dedicating oneself to pure learning with a clear mind eventually results in a self-made uniqueness shaping one's own reality.
